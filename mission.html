        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <h4><em>The Healing Kitchen started as a passion project.</em></h4>
        <p>When my aunt developed Lupis, an autoimmune disease that occurs when your body's immune system attacks your own tissues and organs, she felt like there was no solution to her disease.I began researching any way that I could help her feel like herself again. Through my research I discovered the most important aspect of one's health: your diet. Your diet is the thing that could either make or break you, but many people are unaware just how important your diet is for your overall health.</p>
        <p>After this discovery, I began testing this theory out for myself by creating a meal plan made up of only fresh ingredients, nothing processed and nothing that I was unsure of it's source. Very quickly, my aunt began to reap the rewards of this meal plan. After 2 years of healthy eating, and eliminating any food that was not grown locally, my aunt no longer had any symptoms of the disease that once made her question if she would ever feel like herself again.</p>
        <h4><em>I decided that I had to share this experience with others, to hopefully encourage them to take control of their health and see the difference a healthy diet could make in their lives.</em></h4>
